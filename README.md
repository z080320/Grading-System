## Overview
#### Online Grading System
It is a great idea to use automatic grading system in programming courses, compared with manual grading by instructors. 

An online grading system is a web application developed for accepting student submissions of program source code and automatically grade these submissions based on certain criteria. 

With the maturity of the Internet, an online grading system would be easy to implement and use for programming course instructors.

#### Plagiarism Detection
Plagiarism in programming assignments is quite a common phenomenon for college students. Just a simple copy and paste, they could get a similar grade as other students, without much effort spent in the assignment. This would lead to unfairness and inefficiency in the course instruction. Thus automatic plagiarism detection tool is needed for checking students’ academic honesty, and it makes instructors easier for managing students’ assignment submissions.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an online automatic grading system. In the grading system, it should be easy for course instructors to set questions for students, and it should be convenient for students to submit their answer programs. Besides automatic grading, the grading system must have the capability of plagiarism detection among the source code submitted. 

In this project, a web-based grading system is developed, which would be used by course instructors for programming teaching. It can provide online programming questions to students, and get students’ submissions and grade the students’ answers. Besides, plagiarism detection tool is also designed and implemented with novel plagiarism detection technologies. Plagiarism detection would be applied to the student submissions, and its accuracy would be evaluated.
